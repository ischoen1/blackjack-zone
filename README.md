Welcome to the Blackjack Zone. 

A fully functional and accurate blackjack game. This game is to help learn the strategies from the book "Beat the Dealer - A Winning Strategy for the Game of Twenty-One" by Edward O. Thorp. 

The game will have the capabilities to control how many decks are in use at once, the ability to play more than one hand at once, the ability to change rules to fit particular casinos, the ability to pick how many other cpu players there are and thier expeirience level, and a checkable counter.

This game is currently in the beginning stages of the project and this file will be
